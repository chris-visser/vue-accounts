# Packages

The packages directory contains officially supported addon packages for vue-accounts. 
There are 3 types of addons:

- **Stores** form the connection between the Vuex store and the backend / identity provider
- **Components** add the forms, buttons and behaviors to the accounts system
- **Strategies** form the onboarding flows by hiding/showing, redirecting etc.
